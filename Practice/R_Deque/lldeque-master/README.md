# A simple linked list-based deque implementation

This repository contains a linked list-based implementation of a deque for storing `int`s.  The deque is specified in `lldeque.h` and implemented in `lldeque.c`.  There is also a small program in `test_lldeque.c` to demonstrate the deque.  You can compile the test program using the provided `Makefile` and run it as follows:
```
make
./test_lldeque
```
